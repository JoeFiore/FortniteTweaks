### **What is this?**

**If you are looking for Lunchbox's Fortnite Tweaks, your in the right area!**

1. Program Purpose and Benefits

**Core Function**
This is a comprehensive system optimization utility designed to reduce system latency, improve performance, and declutter your Windows installation. It achieves this by applying a series of advanced registry tweaks, power management changes, and debloating routines.
**Target Audience**
PC gamers, competitive users, streamers, or anyone seeking maximum responsiveness and performance from their Windows system.
**Key Benefits**
Lower Input Lag: Tweaks target I/O system and processor scheduling to reduce delays between input and on-screen action. Increased FPS/Stability: Removal of background processes and unnecessary services (debloat). System Cleanup: Automated temporary file and cache cleaning. **Optimized Power**
Custom power plan for high-performance CPU scheduling.

**2. Safety, Preparation, and Requirements**

### **⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: PROCEED WITH CAUTION**

This tool modifies core Windows operating system settings (Registry, System Services, Power Management). While designed for performance, improper use or configuration may lead to system instability.

    LIABILITY: The developers are not liable for any issues, data loss, or system instability resulting from the use of these tweaks. You use this software at your own risk.

**System Requirements**

    Operating System: Windows 10 or Windows 11 (Tweaks are optimized for modern versions).

    Permissions: Requires Administrator privileges to run all functions.

    Internet Access: Required for the initial setup to download essential utilities and resources.

**Safety Features (Pre-Tweak)**

    System Restore Point: The very first time you access the main tweaks section, the program automatically creates a System Restore Point (labeled as a program-specific restore point). This is your primary way to undo changes if you encounter issues.

    App Reinstallation: The Debloat menu includes an option to reinstall the removed Windows Store Apps, allowing you to reverse the debloating process if necessary.
